To create a Chart within Obsidian a Codeblock of the type `chart` is used. The Properties are set using YAML Syntax. Example:

````yaml
```chart
    type: ""
    labels: []
    series:
        - title: ""
        data: []
        - title: ""
        data: []

```
````

The `title` Property _can_ be omitted, but it is not advised to do so.

:::caution

You might **not** be able to copy the Examples directly into Obsidian, the Indentation is probably wrong and Obsidian tries to convert pasted Text to Markdown, which escapes a few important characters.

:::

You can either manually write these Codeblocks **or** use the graphical Creator.

### Graphical Chart Creator

For simple Charts you can use the graphical Chart Creator, you can access it via the Command Palette or you can even set a Hotkey!
