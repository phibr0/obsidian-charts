# Radar Chart

## Example

````yaml
```chart
    type: radar
    labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
    series:
        - title: Title 1
        data: [1,2,3,4,5]
        - title: Title 2
        data: [5,4,3,2,1]
    width: 40%
```
````

The above example Code will render a _Radar Chart_, a `width` Modifier is already added, since this Chart would be way to big otherwise.
