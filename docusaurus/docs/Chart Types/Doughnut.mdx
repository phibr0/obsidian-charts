# Doughnut and Pie Chart

The Doughnut and Pie Chart work in the same way.

## Example

### Pie Chart

````yaml
```chart
    type: pie
    labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
    series:
        - title: Title 1
        data: [1,2,3,4,5]
        - title: Title 2
        data: [5,4,3,2,1]
    width: 40%
    labelColors: true
```
````

The above example Code will render a _Pie Chart_, a `width` Modifier is already added, since this Chart would be way to big otherwise. The Property `labelColors` is also set to `true`, which is the desired behaviour most of the time.

### Doughnut Chart

````yaml
```chart
    type: doughnut
    labels: [Monday,Tuesday,Wednesday,Thursday,Friday]
    series:
        - title: Title 1
        data: [1,2,3,4,5]
        - title: Title 2
        data: [5,4,3,2,1]
    width: 40%
    labelColors: true
```
````
